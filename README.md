# 64DITP
64DITP (Survivor-esque competition with 64 competitors) simulator. Inspired by Brantsteele, but is randomly generated (no stats yet).

Very crude. I made this out of boredom because I like doing these types of competitions. Beware!
# Configuration
Use a site (I prefer https://commaquote.azurewebsites.net) to format 64 names of your choice into string format. Then, replace the "names" list with your cast's names.
Furthermore you can change tribe names, but I haven't really made an easy way to do this yet.
